# 🍇 Fruit Genius — Fruit Type Predictor

**[Live Demo →](https://fruit-genius.onrender.com)**  
Predict the type of a fruit based on its name using machine learning (Naive Bayes + TF-IDF). This simple yet smart Flask app is styled with a dark, glassy UI and is ready to deploy on Render or locally.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

Just type in a fruit name like `mango`, `apple`, or `dragonfruit`, and the app predicts whether it's:

- 🟠 **Citrus**
- 🫐 **Berry**
- 🍍 **Tropical**
- 🍑 **Stone Fruit**
- 🍎 **Pome**
- …or `None` if it's unknown.

The app uses a trained scikit-learn model under the hood and supports real-time predictions through a Flask web interface.
